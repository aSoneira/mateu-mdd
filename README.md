# mateu-mdd

mateu-mdd is a framework to create awesome applications from our java classes (lightweight Model Driven Development, aka MDD).

So, you define your data model using JPA annotated java classes and it generates an application (desktop, web or mobile) to maintain your data.

Besides looking at JPA annotation, it provides its own annotations for a fine grained control of the user interface. 

I hope you like it ;)
